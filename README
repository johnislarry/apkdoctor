Ideas for remediations:

Baseline Profiles:
- See if baseline profile exists
- Decompile baseline profile and check method coverage.

App Size:
- Breakdown of file size per file type, dex, native code, JS, etc.
- assets/ file size histogram
- Identify good candidates for compression

Security:
- Filter the output of running `strings` for dictionary words and detect suspicious.

Native Code:
- Check for unstripped native libs.
